# CryptoClustering: Unveiling Cryptocurrency Market Dynamics

## Overview
This project explores Crypto Clustering, predicting cryptocurrency fluctuations over 24-hour and 7-day intervals, utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to enhance clustering outcomes.

### Objective
The primary aim of this project is to leverage PCA for improved clustering, facilitating a deeper understanding of cryptocurrency market behaviors. This approach simplifies the data dimensionality and also yields clusters that are more interpretable and insightful, compared to those derived without PCA.

## Techniques 

### Data Preparation
- Data Loading
- Data Normalization

### Clustering Analysis
* Comparing original scaled data with the optimized PCA data

## Key Findings

- **PCA Efficacy**: The application of PCA significantly improved the clustering quality, making the clusters more distinct and interpretable.
- **Optimal Cluster Count**: The project provides insights into the optimal number of clusters for both the original and PCA-transformed data, utilizing elbow curves.
- **Impact of Dimensionality Reduction**: The use of PCA for feature reduction not only simplifies the dataset but also enhances the clustering outcome, thereby facilitating a more nuanced understanding of cryptocurrency market dynamics.

## Conclusion

This project underscores the utility of PCA in enhancing data clustering, particularly in the complex and fast-evolving cryptocurrency market. Through thoughtful analysis and strategic data manipulation, we uncover patterns and insights that could inform investment strategies and market analysis. Currencies that form their own clusters, like Etherlend and Celsius-degree, exhibit volatility patterns not found in the majority of currencies. Reducing the dimensions by utilizing PCA helped identify these outliers.
